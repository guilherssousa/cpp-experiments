## C++ Experiments

This repository contains a collection of C++ experiments. The experiments are, essentially, a collection of small programs that I wrote to learn about C++.

### List of programs

1. Hex dump - `hex_dump.cpp`
2. Read Save File Header - `read_save_file.h`
3. Hex dump with imports - `hex_dump_external_function.cpp`
